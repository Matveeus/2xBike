    "review2": "I work at Glovo on a regular bicycle and at best earn 150 złoty a day. On x2bike, I earned 265 złoty on the very first day and set it up as a scooter in the app. Very satisfied. Really good tool for earning.",
    "review3": "Everything was excellent, the processing was fast, used it for two weeks but returned due to personal circumstances. The bicycle is good, accelerates to 35-40 km/h on a flat road with one button, has suspension. There were no problems with the return. In the future, I will probably use their services again.",
